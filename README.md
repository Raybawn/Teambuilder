# Teambuilder

## What?

A simple, easy to use teambuilder that also looks good.

It allows you to create completely random or balanced (and still random) teams.
In the latter case, the corresponding skills of the individual members are taken into account.

## And how?

- Enter player name
- Determine skill level
- Add the player to the pool
- Choose the number of teams
- Choose between random and balanced teams
- ???
- Profit

## Ok great! But why?

This project serves me to learn web development. And I wanted to do something that could be helpful for others as well.
It's a great way to stay motivated and keep learning.
